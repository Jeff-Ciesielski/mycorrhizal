# Rhizomorph

Asyncio-friendly **Behavior Trees** for Python, designed for clarity, composability, and ergonomics in asynchronous systems.

- **Fluent decorator chains**: `bt.failer().gate(N.condition).timeout(0.5)(N.action)`
- **Owner-aware composites**: factories expand with the correct class owner, so large trees can be split across modules
- **Cross-tree composition**: embed full subtrees with `bt.subtree()` or borrow composites with `bt.bind()`
- **Mermaid diagrams**: export static structure diagrams for documentation/debugging
- **Timebases**: simulate or control time with pluggable clocks (wall/UTC/monotonic/cycle/dictated)

## Quick Example

```python
from types import SimpleNamespace
from rhizomorph.core import bt, Tree, Runner, Status  # adjust import path as needed

class Patrol(Tree):
    @bt.condition
    def has_waypoints(bb) -> bool:
        return getattr(bb, "waypoints", 0) > 0

    @bt.action
    async def go_to_next(bb) -> Status:
        # pretend this takes a few ticks
        if bb.waypoints <= 0:
            return Status.SUCCESS
        bb.waypoints -= 1
        return Status.RUNNING if bb.waypoints > 0 else Status.SUCCESS

    @bt.sequence(memory=True)
    def Root(N):
        yield N.has_waypoints
        # left→right: timeout(1.0) applied to go_to_next
        yield bt.timeout(1.0)(N.go_to_next)

    ROOT = Root

# runner.py
async def main():
    bb = SimpleNamespace(waypoints=3)
    runner = Runner(Patrol, bb=bb)

    while True:
        status = await runner.tick()
        print("Status:", status.name, "remaining:", bb.waypoints)
        if status in (Status.SUCCESS, Status.FAILURE):
            break
```

## Fluent Decorator Chains

Decorator wrappers are available via **fluent chains** that read left→right and apply to a child when called at the end:

```python
yield bt.failer().gate(N.battery_ok).timeout(0.25)(N.engage)
```

**Reads left→right:**

1. `failer()` → forces **FAILURE** once the child completes (whether the child succeeds or fails). While the child is RUNNING, RUNNING bubbles.
2. `gate(N.battery_ok)` → only ticks the child if `battery_ok` returns SUCCESS. If the condition returns RUNNING, the whole gate is RUNNING. If it returns FAILURE, the gate returns FAILURE without ticking the child.
3. `timeout(0.25)` → if the child does not finish before 0.25 (per the configured timebase), it is cancelled/reset and the decorator returns FAILURE.
4. Applied to `N.engage`.

### Wrapper Cheat‑Sheet

| Wrapper | Signature | RUNNING behavior | On child SUCCESS | On child FAILURE/ERROR/CANCELLED | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `inverter()` | `bt.inverter()` | Pass-through | **FAILURE** | **SUCCESS** (for FAILURE); ERROR/CANCELLED pass through | Only flips SUCCESS/FAILURE; other statuses bubble |
| `succeeder()` | `bt.succeeder()` | Pass-through | **SUCCESS** | **SUCCESS** | Forces success once child completes |
| `failer()` | `bt.failer()` | Pass-through | **FAILURE** | **FAILURE** | Forces failure once child completes |
| `timeout()` | `bt.timeout(seconds: float)` | RUNNING until deadline; then **FAILURE** | Child status on completion | Child status on completion (unless deadline hit) | Uses the tree’s `Timebase`; cancels child when expired |
| `retry()` | `bt.retry(max_attempts: int, retry_on=(FAILURE, ERROR))` | Pass-through | **SUCCESS** and resets attempt count | Retries while child in `retry_on` until attempts exhausted → **FAILURE** | Does not retry on RUNNING or CANCELLED by default |
| `ratelimit()` | `bt.ratelimit(hz: float=None, period: float=None)` | If child is currently RUNNING, pass-through (no throttling) | Propagates child result and schedules next allowed start | If throttled: returns **RUNNING** (child not started) | Accepts exactly one of `hz` or `period` |
| `gate()` | `bt.gate(condition: NodeSpec | @bt.condition)` | If condition RUNNING → **RUNNING** | Ticks child and propagates its terminal status | If condition not SUCCESS → **FAILURE** | Condition is built owner‑aware under the hood |

> Tip: You can compose wrappers in any order. The chain is applied **outside‑in** (the leftmost wrapper becomes the outermost decorator).

## Nodes & Composites

### Leaves

- `@bt.action` — wraps an async or sync function.  
  - May return `Status`, `bool`, or `None` (treated as `SUCCESS`).  
  - Exceptions become `ERROR` (except `asyncio.CancelledError` → `CANCELLED`).

- `@bt.condition` — wraps an async or sync predicate.  
  - Truthy → `SUCCESS`, falsy → `FAILURE`.  
  - Returning a `Status` is allowed but discouraged; use plain booleans.

### Composites (owner‑aware factories)

Define composites as **generator factories** that yield children. The factory receives the **owner class** `N`, so you reference members with `N.<member>` (no strings).

- `@bt.sequence(memory: bool = True)`  
  **AND**: ticks children in order.  
  - Fail/err/cancel **fast** (propagate child status).  
  - `RUNNING` bubbles.  
  - All `SUCCESS` → `SUCCESS`.  
  - With `memory=True`, on a subsequent tick it **resumes from the last RUNNING child**. With `memory=False`, it restarts from the first child each tick.

- `@bt.selector(memory: bool = True, reactive: bool = False)`  
  **OR**: ticks children until one returns `SUCCESS`.  
  - `RUNNING` bubbles (and may set/resume index depending on `memory`/`reactive`).  
  - If none succeed → `FAILURE`.  
  - With `memory=True`, the selector **remembers the last RUNNING child** and resumes there next tick.  
  - With `reactive=True`, the selector **always restarts from the first child each tick** (ignoring the memory index). This is helpful when higher-priority options may become available and should preempt lower-priority ones.

- `@bt.parallel(success_threshold: int, failure_threshold: Optional[int] = None)`  
  Ticks all children concurrently per tick.  
  - Success if at least `success_threshold` children return `SUCCESS`.  
  - Failure if at least `failure_threshold` children are in {`FAILURE`, `ERROR`, `CANCELLED`}.  
  - Otherwise `RUNNING`.  
  - Default `failure_threshold = n - success_threshold + 1` (i.e., once success is impossible).

#### On owner‑aware expansion

Inside diagramming and building, composites are expanded with the correct **owner class** context. This lets you split behavior across modules while keeping references (`N.something`) type‑safe and string‑free.

## Cross‑Tree Composition

- `bt.subtree(OtherTree)` — mounts another tree’s `ROOT` as a child; for Mermaid export the `ROOT` spec is attached so it expands visually.  
- `bt.bind(Owner, Owner.Composite)` — borrows a composite from another class and expands it using that **Owner** as the context.

**Example**

```python
class Engage(Tree):
    @bt.condition
    def threat_detected(bb) -> bool: ...
    @bt.action
    async def engage(bb) -> Status: ...
    @bt.sequence(memory=False)
    def Root(N):
        yield N.threat_detected
        yield bt.failer().timeout(0.25)(N.engage)
    ROOT = Root

class Telemetry(Tree):
    @bt.action
    async def push(bb) -> Status: ...
    @bt.sequence()
    def Root(N):
        yield bt.ratelimit(hz=2.0)(N.push)
    ROOT = Root

class Main(Tree):
    @bt.selector(reactive=True, memory=True)
    def Root(N):
        yield bt.subtree(Engage)
        yield bt.bind(Telemetry, Telemetry.Root)
    ROOT = Root
```

## Mermaid Export

```python
from rhizomorph.core import to_mermaid, bt
from main import Main

diagram = to_mermaid(bt._as_spec(Main.ROOT), owner_cls=Main)
print(diagram)
```
Paste the output into the Mermaid Live Editor.

## Runner & Tree

- `class Tree` — container for `@bt.action`, `@bt.condition`, and composite factories. Set `ROOT` to a composite or spec.  
  - `Tree.build()` builds the executable root node.  
- `class Runner(tree_cls, bb=None, tb=None)` — ticks the tree.  
  - `await runner.tick()` — ticks once; advances the timebase if it supports `.advance()`.  
  - `await runner.tick_until_complete(timeout: Optional[float]=None)` — loops until terminal status or timeout.

---

## Status Values

- `SUCCESS`, `FAILURE`, `RUNNING`, `CANCELLED`, `ERROR`

## FAQ: **Sequence.memory vs Selector.memory vs Selector.reactive**

**Q: Isn’t `selector(reactive=True)` contradictory with `selector(memory=True)`? What about `sequence(memory=True)`?**

**A:** They are orthogonal and apply in different moments of control flow:

- `sequence(memory=True)` — remembers **which child was RUNNING** and resumes from that index on the **next tick**. If a child returns a terminal status (SUCCESS/FAILURE/ERROR/CANCELLED), the sequence resets its index (start from 0 next time).

- `selector(memory=True)` — similarly remembers the last **RUNNING** child and resumes there on the next tick. If a child returns `SUCCESS`, the selector resets its index (start from 0 next time).

- `selector(reactive=True)` — **overrides the starting index at the beginning of every tick** to 0, regardless of memory. This makes the selector *reactive*: higher‑priority children are re‑considered each tick (useful when world state can change). While the tick is in progress, `memory=True` still matters: if a child returns `RUNNING` during the current tick, that child becomes the one to resume if the tick is re‑entered before the outer nodes finish. But on the very next outer tick, `reactive=True` causes the selector to start again from child 0.

**Rule of thumb:**  
- Use `sequence(memory=True)` for long‑running steps that you want to resume mid‑pipeline.  
- Use `selector(memory=True)` when you want to continue trying the same alternative until it finishes.  
- Add `reactive=True` when you want the selector to **re‑check higher‑priority options every tick**, even if a lower‑priority option was previously RUNNING.

---

## Design Principles

- **Async‑first** — every node can be `async def`; scheduling is `asyncio`‑based.  
- **String‑free** — reference nodes via `N.<member>` (no magic strings).  
- **Composable** — split and recombine trees across modules with `subtree`/`bind`.  
- **Fluent‑only** — decorator chains read naturally left→right.
