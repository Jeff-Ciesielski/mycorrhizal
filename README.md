# Mycorrhizal

A  library for building safe, structured, concurrent, event-driven systems in Python.

## Overview

Mycorrhizal provides a foundation for creating complex, interconnected systems through specialized modules that work together like fungal networks in nature. Built on gevent, it enables the creation of robust concurrent applications using established computational patterns.

## Architecture

The library is organized into interconnected modules:

- **hypha** - Colored Object Centric Petri nets
- **enoki** - Structured Finite State Machines
- **cordyceps** - Channel-based communication and message routing

Each module can be used independently or combined to build sophisticated event-driven systems for robotics, control systems, distributed computing, and other concurrent applications.
